Brief Application Description:
- Fix Your Mix is an application designed for Spotify users looking for a more personalized, enhanced experience and offers greater functionality for playlists. With Fix Your Mix, users can create, edit, and sort playlists with greater ease and export the modified playlist back into Spotify or share with other users. A dynamic visualizer is included when users preview songs. The final feature is a concert listing that will show what artists in a playlist have upcoming concerts near the user for a specified location. 
When sorting through playlists, users will be able to sort by categories such as decades, release date, date added to playlist, or alphabetically by artists or songs. Enhanced editing tools allow users to mass delete or add songs through filters including artist, date released, date added, and song genre. The visualizer will respond to the frequency, intensity, and rhythm of the music and aims to enhance the user experience while listening to songs.
