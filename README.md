Brief Application Description:
- Fix Your Mix is an application for Spotify users looking to enhance their experience and offers greater functionality for playlists. Fix Your Mix includes features such as creating, editing, and sorting playlists. This application is able to export the modified playlist back into Spotify and be shared with other users. A unique visualizer is included when users preview songs. The final feature is a concert listing that will show what artists in a playlist have upcoming concerts near the user for a specified location.
When sorting through playlists, users will be able to sort by categories such as decades, release date, date added to playlist, or alphabetically by artists or songs. With our enhanced editing, users can mass delete or add songs using filters including artist, date released, date added, and song genre. The visualizer will respond to the frequency, intensity, and rhythm of the music and aims to enhance the user experience while listening to songs.
